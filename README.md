# Minding the Gap: CLT Transit & Job Access

This project analyzes job accessibility across Charlotte by measuring how many employment opportunities fall within a ½-mile walkshed of the city’s fixed-guideway transit system (LYNX). Using GIS methods, spatial data, and demographic indicators, the project identifies underserved job centers, highlights inequities in transit access, and provides evidence to guide corridor planning and last-mile improvements.

Developed during the final Data Science Studio of my undergraduate degree, this project was completed over a full semester of group collaboration, research, and multiple presentations. It serves as my capstone project.

> Technologies: Pandas, ArcGIS Pro, GeoPandas, Matplotlib
